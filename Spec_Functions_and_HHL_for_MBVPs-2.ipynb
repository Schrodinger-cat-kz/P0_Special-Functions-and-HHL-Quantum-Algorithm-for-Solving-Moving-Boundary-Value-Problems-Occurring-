    "Electrical contacts, their design and reliability play crucial role in designing modern electrical apparatuses. A lot of electric contact phenomena accompanied with heat and mass transfer like arcing and bridging are very rapid (nanosecond range) <sup>[1,](#holm)</sup><sup>[2](#slade)</sup> that their experimental study is very difficult or sometimes impossible and the need of their mathematical modeling is due not only to the need to optimize the planning experiment, but also sometimes due to the impossibility to use a different approach. Free (FBVPs) and Moving Boundary Value Problems (MBVPs) take in account phase transformations <sup>[3,](#fried70)</sup><sup>[4](#rub)</sup>, agree with experimental data and can serve as models for aforementioned processes <sup>[5,](#khar16)</sup><sup>[6,](#khar15)</sup><sup>[7](#kharsar12)</sup>.\n",
    "From theoretical point of view, these problems are among the most challenging problems in the theory of non-linear parabolic equations, which along with the desired solution an unknown moving boundary has to be found. In some specific cases it is possible to construct Heat Potentials for which, boundary value problems can be reduced to integral equations <sup>[3,](#fried70)</sup><sup>[4,](#rub)</sup><sup>[8](#tikh)</sup>. However, in the case of domains that degenerate at the initial time, there are additional difficulties due to the singularity of integral equations, which belong to the class of pseudo - Volterra equations which can be solved in special cases and hard to solve in general case. A reader can refer to the long list of studies in <sup>[9](#tar)</sup> and literature therein dedicated to the MBVPs. Despite the great value and exhaustiveness of all these results, investigation and elaboration of both exact and approximate methods for solving MBVPs responsible for adequate modeling electric contact phenomena  is still an actual mathematical problem.\\\\\n",

    "In previous section we considered $\\alpha\\sqrt{t}$ case, as for arbitrary $\\alpha(t)$ boundary we follow same principle and use Fa Di Bruno's Formula in combination with HHL quantum algorithm to find exact solutions.
